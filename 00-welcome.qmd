# Syllabus tl;dr

## Grade Brakedown

* **5%**:  Check-Ins, i.e., pay attention to lecture

* **10%**:  Section, attendance is required

* **25%**:  Lab assignments, due Fridays at 5pm

* **15% each:** Exams in Week 5 and Week 9.

* **30%:** Final project

## Important Dates

* **Weds, May 1:** Exam 1 in class

* **Fri, May 17:** One-page project proposal/abstract

* **Weds, May 29:** Exam 2 in class

* **Finals Week:**  Final project poster presentation

## Homework Late Policy

* -10% per day for the first 5 days

* After that, we won't grade your work - a perfect complete assignment gets 50%, anything else gets 0%.

* (Yes, even if you turn it in at 5pm on Friday of Week 10.)

* One "auto-extension": Fill out the form on Canvas before the deadline, get the "first 5 days" penalty removed.

## Missing Section

* **Best option:** Go to another section.  Email both TAs the day before.

* **Second-best option:** Turn in your work by email to your TA and CA.

* **Worst option:** Miss it entirely, get a 0.

* *You may do each of these options only twice. If you need to miss/reschedule more than 6 of the sections in the quarter, you will need to retake the class.*

## Discord and Email

* Class questions go on **DISCORD**

* Use the staff email list **only** for private questions, like grade questions or personal concerns.

* Use my email **only** for personal concerns that you want to talk about privately to me.

# Setup

## Colab Notebooks

* In Data Science, everyone uses **Notebooks**, not scripts, for coding.

* We will be using **Jupyter Notebooks** (invented at Cal Poly!), hosted for free by **Google Colab**.

* If you want to work offline, you can install **Anaconda** on your laptop.

* I recommend an IDE like **PyCharm** as well.


# The Brave New World of GenAI

## Academic Integrity

* If you copy text from a website into your essay, it's cheating.

* If you ask your friend to write your essay, it's cheating.

* If you pay someone else to write your essay, it's cheating.

....

* If you ask GenAI to do your work and then copy the answers, it's cheating.


## Conversation, not copying

It is okay (in fact, encouraged) to ...

* Ask GenAI for tips on how to get started on a coding problem

* Ask GenAI to help find bugs in your code

* Ask GenAI to help explain concepts or functions

* **Pretend ChatGPT is your human tutor or TA!**
