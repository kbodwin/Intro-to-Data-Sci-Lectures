What is a Choropleth?

A **choropleth** is a map where each region is colored according to some
statistic.

Let's make a choropleth of kidney cancer death rates by U.S. county.

Seeing Patterns

-   Humans have evolved a remarkable ability to see patterns\...

-   \...even when there are none.

-   Statistics is a science that helps us disentangle real patterns in
    data from noise by:

    -   quantifying the **signal** in a pattern

    -   quantifying the **noise**.

-   Take a statistics class during your college years!

    (DATASCI 112 is not a statistics class!)

# Cautions about Choropleths

"Oh I love those beautiful red areas, that middle of the map. There's
just a little blue here, and a little blue, everything else is bright
red."

"\[Trump\] interrupted himself and handed out this map of the electoral
college and said that these were the latest figures of the areas of the
country that he had won in 2016."

of us."

The Problem with Choropleths

The election choropleth violates one of Tufte's principles of data
visualization:

> The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface
> of the graph itself, should be directly proportional to the numerical
> quantities represented.

Trump mistakes the red area on the map as representing the number of
people who voted for him.

These maps are highly custom and are difficult to make on your own.
