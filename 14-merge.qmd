## The story so far

### Data analysis: the whole game

* **Acquire** data and **clean** it by fixing variable types, dropping or replacing missing data, and looking for other issues.

* **Explore** the dataset by making summaries and plots of *one variable*.

* Establish **research questions** to answer with this data.

* Create **visualizations** of *two or more variables* that address simple questions.

* Fit **predictive models** to address more complex questions, and/or to prepare for prediction on future data.

* Fit **unsupervised models** to answer open-ended questions.

## Joining on a Key

### Example: Planes and flights

* Sometimes, information is spread across multiple data sets.

* For example, suppose we want to know which manufacturer's planes made the most flights in November 2013.

* One data set contains information about flights in Nov. 2013...

``` {python}
import pandas as pd
data_dir = "https://datasci112.stanford.edu/data/nycflights13/"
df_flights = pd.read_csv(f"{data_dir}/flights11.csv")
df_flights.head()
```


### Example: Planes and Flights

...while another contains information about planes.

``` {python}
df_planes = pd.read_csv(f"{data_dir}/planes.csv")
df_planes.head()
```

In order to answer the question of which manufacturer made the most
flights, we have to join these two data sets together.

### Keys

* A **primary key** is a column (or a set of columns) that uniquely
identifies observations in a data frame.

* The **primary key** is the column(s) you would think of as the **index**.

* A **foreign key** is a column (or a set of columns) that points to the primary key of another data frame.

* Planes are uniquely identified by their *tail number*
(`tailnum`).

### Joining on a Key

Each value of the **primary key** should only appear once, but it could appear many times in a **foreign key**.

```{python}
df_flights['tailnum'].value_counts().head()
df_planes['tailnum'].value_counts().head()
```


### Joining on a Key

The Pandas function `.merge()` can be used to join two
`DataFrame`s on a key.

``` {python}
df_joined = df_flights.merge(df_planes, on="tailnum")
df_joined.head()   
```



### Overlapping Column Names


* Joining two data frames results in a *wider* data frame, with more columns.

* By default, Pandas adds the suffixes `_x` and `_y` to overlapping column names, but this can be customized.

``` {python}
df_joined = df_flights.merge(df_planes, on="tailnum",
                             suffixes=("_flight", "_plane"))
df_joined.columns
```


### Analyzing the Joined Data

Now that we have joined the two data sets, we can answer the question: which manufacturer's planes made the most flights?

``` {python}
df_joined["manufacturer"].value_counts()
```

## Joining on Multiple Keys

### Example: Weather and Flights

* Research question: What weather factors cause flight delays?

* Here is a data set containing hourly weather data at each airport
in 2013.

``` {python}
df_weather = pd.read_csv(f"{data_dir}/weather.csv")
df_weather.head()
```

**What is the primary key of this data set?**


### A Key with Multiple Columns

Let's start by looking at flights out of JFK only, for simplicity.

We need to join to the weather data on year, month, day, and hour.

``` {python}
df_flights_jfk = df_flights[df_flights["origin"] == "JFK"]
df_weather_jfk = df_weather[df_weather["airport"] == "JFK"]

df_jfk = df_flights_jfk.merge(df_weather_jfk, on=("year","month","day","hour"))

df_jfk.head()
```


### Let's see how rain affects departure delays.

``` {python}
#| code-fold: true
from plotnine import *

(ggplot(df_jfk, aes(x="precip", y="dep_delay")) +
geom_point(alpha=0.2) +
theme_classic())
```

### Joining on Keys with Different Names

* Sometimes, the join keys have different names in the two data sets. 

* This frequently happens if the data sets come from different sources.

* For example, if we want to join the (entire) flights data to the weather data, we would need to include the *airport* in the key.

* But the airport is called `origin` in `df_flights`
and `airport` in `df_weather`.

* The `.merge()` function provides `left_on=` and
`right_on=` arguments for specifying different column names in
the **left** (first) and **right** (second) data frames.

### Joining on Keys with Different Names

``` {python}
df_flights_weather = df_flights.merge(
    df_weather,
    left_on=("origin", "year", "month", "day", "hour"),
    right_on=("airport", "year", "month", "day", "hour"))
```


### Rain and delays by airport

Now we can visualize how rain impacts delays at each airport:

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
df_rain = df_flights_weather.groupby(["airport", "precip"])["dep_delay"].mean().to_frame().reset_index()

(ggplot(df_rain, aes(x='precip', y='dep_delay', color = 'airport')) +
geom_point() +
geom_line() +
theme_classic())
```


## Joins with missing keys

### Example: Baby names

The data below contains counts of names for babies born in 1920 and 2020:

``` {python}
import pandas as pd
data_dir = "http://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/names/"

df_1920 = pd.read_csv(data_dir + "yob1920.txt", header=None,
                      names=["Name", "Sex", "Count"])
df_2020 = pd.read_csv(data_dir + "yob2020.txt", header=None,
                      names=["Name", "Sex", "Count"])
                      
df_1920.head()
df_2020.head()
```

### Joins

We can merge these two datasets on a primary key...

```{python}
df_joined = df_1920.merge(df_2020, on=["Name", "Sex"], suffixes=("_1920", "_2020"))
df_joined.head()
```



### Missing Keys?

... but what happened to some of the names?

``` {python}
df_joined[df_joined["Name"] == "Maya"]
```

### Missing keys

* Why isn't Maya in the joined data? 

It is there in the 2020 data...

```{python}
df_2020[df_2020["Name"] == "Maya"]
```


...but not in the 1920 data.

```{python}
df_1920[df_1920["Name"] == "Maya"]
```



### Missing keys


* How does the `merge()` function determine which keys get kept?

* By default, in order to appear in the joined data, a key must be present in *both* tables.


## Other Types of Joins


### Types of Joins

* How can we customize the behavior of joins for missing keys?

* By default, Pandas does an **inner join**, which only keeps keys that are present in *both* tables.

* An **outer join** keeps any key that is present in either table.

* A **left join** keeps all keys in the left table, even if they are not in the right table. But any keys that are only in the right table are dropped.

* A **right join** keeps all keys in the right table, even if they are not in the left table. But any keys that are only in the left table are dropped.

### Types of joins

We can customize the type of join using the `how=` parameter of
`.merge()`. By default, `how="inner"`.

``` {python}
df_joined_outer = df_1920.merge(df_2020, on=["Name", "Sex"],
                                how="outer")
df_joined_outer[df_joined_outer["Name"] == "Maya"]
```

### Types of Joins

* Note the missing values for other columns, like Count, for 1920!

* What other type of join would have produced this output in the Maya row?

### Types of Joins

* Note the missing values for other columns, like Count, for 1920!

* What other type of join would have produced this output in the Maya row?

``` {python}
df_joined_right = df_1920.merge(df_2020, on=["Name", "Sex"],
                                how="right")
df_joined_right[df_joined_right["Name"] == "Maya"]
```

## Types of Joins

### Quick Quiz

Which type of join would be best suited for each case?

1. We want to determine the names that have increased in popularity the most between 1920 and 2020.

2.  We want to graph the popularity of names over time.

3.  We want to determine the names that have decreased in popularity the most between 1920 and 2020.

## Many-to-Many Joins

### Many-to-Many Relationships{.smaller}

* So far, the keys we've joined on have been the primary key of (at least) one table.

* If we join to the primary key of another table, then the relationship is **one-to-one** (since primary keys uniquely identify rows).

* If we join to the foreign key of another table, then the relationship is **one-to-many**.

* What if we join on a key that is not a primary key?

* That is, what if the key does not uniquely identify rows in either table so that each value of the key might appear multiple times?

* This relaionship is called **many-to-many**.

### Many-to-Many Example

What if we only joined on the name?

```{python}
df_1920.merge(df_2020, on="Name")
```

### Preventing Bugs

* Most of the time, many-to-many joins are a bug, caused by a
misunderstanding about the primary key.

* Pandas allows us to specify the relationship we are expecting. It will fail with an error if the relationship is a different kind.

* For example, suppose we thought that "name" was the primary key of the baby name tables.

```{python}
#| eval: false
df_1920.merge(df_2020, on="Name",
              validate="one_to_one")
```

```
MergeError: Merge keys are not unique in either left or right dataset; not a one-to-one merge
```

Errors are (sometimes) your friend. They can prevent you from making
even bigger mistakes!

## Filtering Joins

### Filtering Joins{.smaller}

* Inner, outer, left, and right are known as **mutating joins**, because they create new combined datasets.

* There are two other types of joins that we use for **filtering** to get rid of some rows:

* A **semi-join** tells us which keys in the *left* **are** present in the *right*.

* An **anti-join** tells us which keys in the left **are not** present in the right.

* In Pandas, we can't do these using `.merge()`

### Filtering joins

Which names existed in 1920 but don't in 2020?

```{python}
in_both = df_1920['Name'].isin(df_2020['Name'])
df_1920.loc[~in_both, 'Name']
```

### Your turn

* Did your name exist in 2020 but not 1920?

* If so, how has the popularity changed?
